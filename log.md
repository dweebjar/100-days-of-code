# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finished Jonas.io complete JS course. 

**Thoughts:** The course really helped with grasping the fundamentals of JS and understanding the theory behind how it works. I need to start working on real projects now though to solidify that learning.

### Day 2: January 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began reading Eloquent JavaScript. Began working on Pokemon type matching project. 

**Thoughts:** It's really good beginning a project from scratch and figuring out how to implement the information I learned from the Jonas.io course. I hit a few walls, but it was nice to figure out how to push past them.
